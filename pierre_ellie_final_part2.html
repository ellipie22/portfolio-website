  <h1> Final Part 2 Questions by Pierre Ellie</h1>

  <dl>
<dt>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</dt>
  <dd>- From just looking through pages for fun with the inspect button and just reading through it when bored I had very little knowledge of CSS and HTML, but I did have quite a bit of knowledge about JavaScript in the past because of classes that I have taken in High School where I built basic games or calculators with some JavaScript. These classes also taught me about how the internet works in general which is useful knowledge to have in any programming class or class that involves itself with the internet.</dd>
<dt>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</dt>
  <dd> I used a template that was given but I made some ajdustments to make it fit my own prefrences a little more as well to feel not as much like i took the easiest way out. Now mostly the header layout and sizing is the some of the only parts that are the same. </dd>
<dt>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</dt>
  <dd>I found creating the validator for the form as well as making the header look consistant on every single page because of the variety from each page to page and the form has specific criterias that had to be met so that the user can't just input stuff completely off topic or random. </dd>
<dt>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</dt>
  <dd> Yes, this class made me realzie a little bit more about how Web Design isn't really one whole thing that you do at once, instead it's multiple pieces that you put together like a puzzle that you can edit. You can easily create section (divs) with CSS that allows you to not have to change everything individualy in HTML and every single detail of a web page can be more than just the preset choices because you can go into as much detail as you'd like.</dd>
<dt>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</dt>
  <dd> I definitely would for anobody who wants to enter the world of programming. Although it's not as much building large problem solving scripts like some would assume a class under Programming would be, it's bery useful in teaching how you can use the scripts on website and how each website can be different in the way it wants things. It brings in a lot of useful context that I think would  help avoid future confusion for people who want to learn more about programming.</dd>
