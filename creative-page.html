<h2>This is my creative page! I decided to make just about my history with the Seahawks.</h2>
<p>
I have been a Seahawks fan my whole life but I remember first watching their games back in 2014, funnily enough this was the year that they won their first super bowl.

<p>
Since then, I have been keeping up with the Seahawks watching almost every single one of their games and hopefully they can win another super bowl, especially soon since in their recent <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/index.htm" target="_blank">history</a> has been some of the best ever and they've made the playoffs almost every year in the last 10. <br> My favorite Seahawks player has always been Kam Chancellor, he played strong safety and was part of a historically good defence that the Seahawks had, it was nicknames "The Legion of Boom".

<p> Football even inspired me to play some, I played tackle football from 6th to 8th grade, sadly I wasn't able to play in High School because of my parents' disapproval but it's not something I'm too bummed about now that I have been able to have a ton of other opportunities due to the opening in time of my schedule.
